# 281. Zigzag Iterator
Medium

Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

## Example 1

Input:
v1 = [1,2]
v2 = [3,4,5,6] 


Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]


Explanation: By calling  next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
